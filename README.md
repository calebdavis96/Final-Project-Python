# Final-Project-Python
Summary
Needs a summary, what, why, how, the usage/example, and references/citations. Probably a couple paragraphs for each if possible

## What:
The purpose of this project is to create a game of hangman in which the user has to guess characters of a word that has randomly been pulled out of a word bank.

## Why:
I thought this would be an interesting way to test my python skills, and I was very interested by the game of battleship we set up in Codecademy so i decided to do my own. There are plenty of codes for a hangman game online, but many have small flaws and for my game I would like to have it as polished as possible so that someone with no knowledge of python at all could sit down and play without issue.

## How:
First, I found a random word bank generator online and copied a large wordbank and formatted it correctly.I then imported the "random" module so that the game would choose a random word from the list every time the game started.

## Usage/Example:
